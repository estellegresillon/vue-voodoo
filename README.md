# vue-voodoo

Monetization dashboard made with Vue's Composition API and Typescript.

Libraries used : axios, ant-design-vue, dayjs, lodash, vue3-styled-components.

See it live : https://voodoo.estellegresillon.fr/

## Key goals :

- Discover the Composition API
- Work with axios for data fetching
- Install and configure Typescript
- Use ant-design and type it
- Use, parse and format dates with dayjs
- Refactor my previous version of this project made with React at the time

Side note : At first I fetched the data with apollo/graphql but the os/platform field was not exposed by the API.
